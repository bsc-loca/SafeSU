\section{Parameters}
\label{chapter3}
This unit uses several parameters. \textbf{DATA\_WIDTH} defines the size of the data registers.\\
\textbf{WEIGHTS\_WIDTH} defines the size of the registers that store the estimated contention that a given event causes.\textbf{ N\_CORES} is used to configured to replicate the internal logic of the RDC to support several cores. \textbf{CORE\_EVENTS} sets the number of events that are track for each core.\\
\\
Internal parameters are used to perform padding between signals of different width when need to be used together. Such local parameter are\textbf{ O\_D\_0PAD, D\_W\_0PAD, O\_W\_0PAD }further details are provided in the source code comments. \\
\\
Given the previous parameters the unit shall generate correct RTL without any manual modification to the source code.\\
