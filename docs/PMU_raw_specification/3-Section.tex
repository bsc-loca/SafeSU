\section{Parameters}
\label{chapter3}
This unit has few external parameters.\textbf{REG\_WIDTH}, \textbf{N\_COUNTERS} and \textbf{N\_CONF\_REGS} are the basic parameters to configure the memory map of the PMU and route the signals. This parameters are provided by the module instancing the unit. A set of local parameters select the active features (\textbf{OVERFLOW}, \textbf{QUOTA}, \textbf{MCCU}, \textbf{RDC}).\\
\\
Given the previous parameters all the memory map is generates as local parameters as well. For each group of signals associated with a feature function there is a local parameter with the name of the feature and function prefixed by \textbf{BASE\_}, \textbf{N\_} and \textbf{END\_}. This signals have the first register of the feature function, the number of used registers and the last register of the feature, respectively. The total of registers is stored in \textbf{TOTAL\_NREGS} and it adds up all the intermediate parameters with the registers used by each feature.\\
\\
Is key to generate this parameters following a consistent method and build the values of the next parameters based in the last values to prevent inconsistencies. Furthermore all the parameters are important since the C libraries will be generated out of the parameter report generated by spyglass.
