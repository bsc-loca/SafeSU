\section{Reset behavior}

The module contains a single global reset, called rstn\_i it is asynchronous and active low.\\
\\
Any reset when active shall clear any internal register and set them to 0.\\
\\
This unit will filter the reset signals of the MCCU, avoiding any glitch but making the reset synchronous.
