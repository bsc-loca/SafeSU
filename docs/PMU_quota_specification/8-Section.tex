If the quota mask is changed the state-machine that adds the content of the counters shall jump to reset. This will discard the previous addition and start over.\\
\\
The number of N\_COUNTERS shall remain reasonable for each specific implementation of the PMU, large values will increase the latency between the quota been exceeded and the trigger of the interrupt.\\
\\
If the values feed into the unit through counter\_value\_i overflow there is the chance that they overflow after been added to suma\_int. As a result the interrupt of quota may trigger but the values of the counters at that instant may be lower than the limit of quota.
