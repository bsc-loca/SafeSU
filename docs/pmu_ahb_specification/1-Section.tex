\section{General purpose of the module}
This module is the top level for the application specific PMU. 
It implements an AHB slave interface that connects with any compliant master with a 32 wide amba bus.
Wider buses can be used with minimal modifications, for more detail on this matter check AMBA AHB specification \cite{TODO}, section 6.2.1.\\

\\
The module has a set of registers that are synchronized between the interface agnostic PMU and the SoC. Writes to the registers are updated to internal registers of each PMU feature if needed.
