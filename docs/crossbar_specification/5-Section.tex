\section{Reset behavior}

When reset is active (LOW), internal registers are set to 0. In the next cycle outputs of the crossbar will become 0.\\
When reset is not active (HIGH) input signals selected by the configuration fields are routed to the output. Since outputs are registered, we see one cycle of latency.
